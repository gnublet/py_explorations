# py_explorations
My explorations in python code.

## general
For general python, I'm going through Python Essential Reference and http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html. I will follow code examples, but put my own comments and explorations to deepen my own understanding. There's also a web crawler done in scrapy.

## sklearn
In the sklearn folder, I've put some basic data science scripts using the jupyter notebook. I've done classification, clustering, some dimensionality reduction, model selection and parameter tuning. Some things for the future are regression, recommender systems, natural language processing, and time series models.

## datastructures 
standard algorithms and datastructures, and some standard interview-like problems. Maybe should merge into general folder.
